# Windward RESTful V2 Python Client Sample

  
## Setup
NOTE: You NEED to have Python V 3.8.6 (64bit).

Next, locate the `config.ini` file in the project root. This file contains all the config properties needed to run these samples. Open the file and:
1. Set your license
1. Set the address of your RESTful server


## Running the samples

We have three samples in this project:
1. GenerateDocument.py
    - Shows you how to process a document and get output
1. RetrieveMetrics.py
    - Shows you how to get the templates metrics
1. RetrieveTagTree.py
    - Shows you how to get the templates tag tree

All these python files are located in `/src/fluent_demo/` if you want to explore the code.

To run these projects all you need to do is:
1. Navigate to the `/scripts/` directory
1. Double click on the corisponding `.bat` or `.sh` file for the project you want to run. Everrything is setup to work out the box, and it will install the latest version of the package.
